# idk - implementing deep keyboard

Transpiling a imaginary language to Nasm for Linux-x86_64.

Currently, using Kotlin as the interpreter and compiler, but will change in the future.

**WARN:** Don't try to learn from this. Not worth.

### How to? If you are interested!

Only working in the imaginary land. So run `./gradlew test` to run the current AST tests.

```
./gradlew test
```
